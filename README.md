Make sure to add org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter:5.4.2 to your class path.
As long as you get this dependency you will be able to run the tests.
I recommend using the IntelliJ ide for this as it seems to be the fastest when installing dependencies. After cloning the repo
go into the tests package and then into the InterestTest.java file. Go down to the error and right click on it. Then click show context actions.
After that just click add JUnit5 to classpath and follow the steps. After adding the dependency IntelliJ lets you run the entire
class this will allow all the tests to run, the outcome will be 11/11 tests passed.
